## Requirements

All requirements for this app comes from [Poject 3](https://docs.cs50.net/web/2018/x/projects/3/project3.html) of HarvardX CS50W course:

* **Menu**: Your web application should support all of the available menu items for Pinnochio’s Pizza & Subs (a popular pizza place in Cambridge). It’s up to you, based on analyzing the menu and the various types of possible ordered items (small vs. large, toppings, additions, etc.) to decide how to construct your models to best represent the information. Add your models to orders/models.py, make the necessary migration files, and apply those migrations.
* **Adding Items**: Using Django Admin, site administrators (restaurant owners) should be able to add, update, and remove items on the menu. Add all of the items from the Pinnochio’s menu into your database using either the Admin UI or by running Python commands in Django’s shell.
* **Registration, Login, Logout:** Site users (customers) should be able to register for your web application with a username, password, first name, last name, and email address. Customers should then be able to log in and log out of your website.
* **Shopping Cart:** Once logged in, users should see a representation of the restaurant’s menu, where they can add items (along with toppings or extras, if appropriate) to their virtual “shopping cart.” The contents of the shopping should be saved even if a user closes the window, or logs out and logs back in again.
* **Placing an Order:** Once there is at least one item in a user’s shopping cart, they should be able to place an order, whereby the user is asked to confirm the items in the shopping cart, and the total (no need to worry about tax!) before placing an order.
* **Viewing Orders:** Site administrators should have access to a page where they can view any orders that have already been placed.
* **Personal Touch:** Add at least one additional feature of your choosing to the web application. Possibilities include: allowing site administrators to mark orders as complete and allowing users to see the status of their pending or completed orders, integrating with the Stripe API to allow users to actually use a credit card to make a purchase during checkout, or supporting sending users a confirmation email once their purchase is complete. 

## Models

All types od dishes have own class, ending with *Type* (f.e. PizzaType), when you can store information like name, possible additions or prices. From this class, you can form proper models (f.e. Pizza) with available options specific to dish type. When you make an order (with items in cart), Proper Order model is for storing information about your order.


## Views

When you access page, the welcome page will render. If you are unlogged, there will be login form on navbar and button redirecting you to register form. When you are logged, you will see (again, on navbar) buttons to menu, cart, all your orders and logout (with additional "all user's orders" and admin panel, if you are logged as stuff member).

 

Menu view is generate based on all Type models, so it will automaticly adapt to all changes. Making orders in menu is implemented in two ways: form (generated by Django Form's) in pizza section and link-based order in rest possible dishes.

 

All order lists (for both user and stuff) are also automatic generated. In admin form, you can check orders to inform users, that they order is done.

 

In cart, beside list of all product, you will see price of your order and buttons for making it od delete all items in cart.

 

Also, to simplify starting database from scratch, staff members can fill menu with standard Pinocchio's Pizza Menu (available [here](http://www.pinocchiospizza.net/menu.html)) by simply going to */fill_menu* adress.

 

## Quickstart

 

I you want test it, just download this project and start it like all Django apps. Database should be filled from start - if you want to use another database, change setting.py database variables and - after starting webserver - go to */fill_menu*. You can log in with pinocchioadmin (username) and pinocchiopassword (password).

 

## What is SuperPizza

 

SuperPizza, available in menu, is special kind of pizza without topping's number limit - if you choose more than standard 3 topping's, your pizza is automatically chosen as SuperPizza.
